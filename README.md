# Array-Intersection

- There's probably a better and easier of doing this...


Given 2 Arrays, write a function to compute their intersection - the intersection means the numbers that are in both arrays
Note:
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.
	
	```
	EXAMPLE 1:
	Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
	Output: [2]
	```

	```
	Example 2:
	Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
	Output: [9,4]
	```
